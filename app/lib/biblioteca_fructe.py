def culoare_kiwi():
    return "The green kiwi has a fuzzy brown skin and oval shape. Gold kiwifruit, in contrast, has smooth, hairless skin that's a nice golden-brown color. \n Slicing the fruit in half reveals even more differences. Green kiwifruit has, as one would expect, a green flesh with black seeds."

def descriere_kiwi():
    return "The ellipsoidal kiwi fruit is a true berry and has furry brownish green skin. \n The firm translucent green flesh has numerous edible purple-black seeds embedded around a white centre. The deciduous leaves are borne alternately on long petioles (leaf stems), and young leaves are covered with reddish hairs."
