    return "The apricot was originally domesticated in China but is now cultivated on every continent except Antarctica. Archaeological evidence shows that apricots were eaten in ancient Armenia, and they were first introduced to the New World in the early 18th century by Spanish missionaries in California. In 2024 the top five producers of apricots were Turkey, Uzbekistan, Iran, Algeria, and Italy.Apricots are propagated by budding on peach or apricot rootstocks, and peaches, plums, and apricots may be readily intergrafted. The tree succeeds in well-drained loamy soil, preferably light rather than heavy. Most varieties withstand winter cold as well as peaches, but the blossom buds, opening earlier than those of the peach, are frequently killed by late freezes. The trees are quite drought-resistant and under favorable growing conditions are long-lived, some living 100 years or longer."

    return "Apricot, (Prunus armeniaca), economically important fruit tree, cultivated throughout the temperate regions of the world, especially in the Mediterranean. Apricots are closely related to peaches, almonds, plums, and cherries. They are eaten fresh or cooked and are preserved by canning or drying. The fruit is also widely made into jam and is often used to flavor liqueurs. Apricots are a good source of vitamin A and are high in natural sugar. Dried apricots are an excellent source of iron."
